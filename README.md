# PythonLabActivityDefineCallFunction

Introduction:

As a security analyst, when you’re writing out Python code to automate a certain task, you’ll often
find yourself needing to reuse the same block of code more than once. This is why functions are
important. You can call that function whenever you need the computer to execute those steps.
Python not only has built-in functions that have already been defined, but also provides the tools
for users to define their own functions. Security analysts often define and call functions in Python
to automate series of tasks.

Scenario:

Writing functions in Python is a useful skill in your work as a security analyst. In this lab, you’ll
define and a call a function that displays an alert about a potential security issue. Also, you’ll work
with a list of employee usernames, creating a function that converts the list into one string.
